### '8-9-8' (10 or 25 habanos)

![presentacion-898](book_images/styles-of-presentation-ii_presentacion-898.jpg)

Boxes with telltale curved sides. The origin of these boxes was based on the number and arrangement of the cigars inside; 8 on the top row, 9 in the middle and 8 on the bottom making 25. It even gave its name to the first vitola to use it, the Dalia. Today the same 3-layer arrangement is used for boxes of 10; 3 on the top row, 4 in the middle and 3 on the bottom, so there is an 8-9-8 in 10s! All the cigars are round.

### Bundles or Mazos (10 or 25 habanos)
