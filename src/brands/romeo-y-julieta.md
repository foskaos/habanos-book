The name Romeo y Julieta, created as a Habanos brand in 1875, has its roots in the literary tragedy of the same name by the English writer William Shakespeare.
The brand achieved international renown in the early years of the 20th century, after Don "Pepín" Rodríguez, one of the first to recognize the importance of rings as a factor for success.

Winston Churchill was one of the brand's most devoted smokers. Since his visit to Havana in 1946, his name was used on some rings and gave name to the brand's best known vitola: Churchills of Romeo y Julieta.

In 2006, Habanos, S.A. launched the younger brother of this emblematic vitola: Short Churchills, the Robustos of Romeo y Julieta.

Churchills is a mythical name in the Habano. Ever since Winston Churchill's visit to Cuba in 1946, numerous elements have reflected this personality's fondness for Habano in his rings.

First it was the Churchills, then the Short Churchills and, in 2010, two new vitolas of this famous brand were introduced: Wide Churchills, a new format that inaugurates the 55 ring gauge for the trend among lovers of thick ring gauge vitolas, and Julieta.
