Herman Upmann was a German banker whose love for Habanos led him to settle in Havana in 1844 and found a bank and a Habanos factory in this city.

Over time, the bank closed, but his brand of cigars persists today as an example of the most refined Habanos medium strength flavour Habanos. The H. Upmann blend, with a light to medium strength, is obtained from leaves coming from the Vuelta Abajo zone, in the Pinar del Río region. All its vitolas are made "Totalmente a Mano con Tripa Larga "– Totally handmade with Long Filler.

The gold medals adorning the H. Upmann box were obtained in no less than eleven international fairs throughout the nineteenth century, as a reward for the brand's quality and inimitable aroma.

In 2008, the Magnum 50 was presented, a vitola that forms a Linea of its own together with the Magnum 46. This Linea has a differentiated presentation within the brand.

The vitola Half Corona was presented in 2011, specially designed for those who want to enjoy the full flavour of the Habano in a short smoke, or those who want to get closer to the Habano through the aromatic and balanced flavour of H. Upmann .
