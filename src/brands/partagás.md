If there is a particularly famous Habanos factory in Havana, it is Partagás. For many years this Factory was located at 520 Industria Street, right behind the Havana's Capitol, in the heart of the city. Today, the Factory is located at 806 San Carlos Street.

The factory was created in 1845 by Don Jaime Partagás, and has been producing this prestigious Habanos brand ever since.

Partagás Habanos are immediately recognizable for their intense flavour. The character of its blend, made up of selected cigars from the Vuelta Abajo area, in the Pinar del Río region, is of inimitable richness and aroma.

The Partagás vitolario is characterized by a wide variety of shapes and sizes.

The Partagás Tropicales Humidor has been chosen by Habanos, S.A. to commemorate the celebration of the brand's 175th anniversary, being one of the most awaited novelties for demanding Habanos lovers.

Tropicales has been the vitola selected to make up this special humidor. The vitola is of an even elegant format, and with unique measurements within the brand's portfolio (54ring gauge x 175 mm length), ideal for those aficionados who appreciate large-format and long-lasting vitolas.

In 2014 the brand hosted the launch of Series D No. 6 and in 2015 the concept of aged cigars was inaugurated with two reference brands, Montecristo and Romeo y Julieta, followed by Partagás Coronas Gordas.
