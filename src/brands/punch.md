Punch is one of the oldest Habanos brands. Don Manuel López de Juan Valle and Cia founded this brand in the mid-19th century, with the idea of ​​attacking the growing English market, where a humorous publication of the same name was in vogue in those days.

Mr. Punch, the clown that was the symbol of that publication, continues to appear in each of the brand's boxes with his Habano in hand, surrounded by 19th-century images that shows the making of Habanos, and that are practically the same as those that today can be seen in factories in Cuba.

In 1931, Punch moved to the factory where Hoyo de Monterrey was produced; a long association that continues today. Actually, the two brands are produced at La Corona factory.

The characteristic flavour and medium strength of Punch, made with a blend mixed of filler and wrapper leaves coming from the Vuelta Abajo zone, are available in a range of vitolas that are made "Totally Handmade with long filler".

The historic Habanos brand created in the mid-19th century, Punch, presented its latest release in 2019: the new Short de Punch vitola, which expands the brand's chart size by incorporating, for the first time, the 50 ring gauge.
