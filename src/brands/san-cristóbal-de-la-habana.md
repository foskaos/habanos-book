The original name of the San Cristóbal de la Habana brand was the name given to the city of Havana in 1519. This brand was launched in 1999 as a tribute to the city's long history at the dawn of the new millennium.

The brand placed on the market for the first time with a range of four vitolas, whose names correspond to the fortresses located in the city, built between the 16th and 18th centuries by the Spaniards to defend the city from possible aggressions: El Morro, La Fuerza, La Punta and El Príncipe.

El Morro and La Fuerza correspond to factory sizes that are only present in this brand.

In 2004, the brand's chart size was expanded with Mercaderes, Oficios and Murallas, which are the names of well-known streets in the historic center of the city, Old Havana.

All the vitolas are made "Totally by Hand with Tripa Larga", with tripa leaves and capote from the Vuelta Abajo area. They are characterized by a mild to medium-flavored blend. All the Habanos of the brand are made "Totalmente a Mano con Tripa Larga"- Totally handmade with Long Filler, with wrapper and filler leaves coming from the Vuelta Abajo zone. They are characterized by having a light to medium flavour blend.
