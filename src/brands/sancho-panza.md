Sancho Panza, like other great Habanos brands such as Montecristo and Romeo y Julieta, the brand's name was inspired by one of the main works of universal literature and the most prominent in Spanish literature, Don Quixote de la mancha, written by Miguel de Cervantes in the seventeenth century. Sancho Panza gives its name to this brand as Don Quixote's faithful squire.

The first registration of the brand dates back to 1848, and since then, it has always been known for its high quality, capable of satisfying the most demanding smokers. The range today comprises three Habanos including the famous Molino, which is a Cervantes factory name. Don Quixote was, of course, famous for tilting at windmills that he identified as giants.
