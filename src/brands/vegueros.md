Vegueros brand was introduced to the market in 1996 and pays tribute to all the farmers who from generation to generation have cultivated tobacco in the "Pinar del Río" region, Cuba.

It is a tradition in the "Vuelta Abajo" zone, for the vegueros – farmers – to make their own cigars. Visitors to this part of Pinar del Río province were curious and wanted to taste the cigars made in the land where the considered best tobacco in the world is grown.

Vegueros brand is made at the "Francisco Donatién" Factory, in a sturdy building located in Pinar del Río, was built in 1868, and converted into a cigar factory in 1961.
