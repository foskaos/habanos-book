# Special Productions

From time to time you will see special productions of Habanos offering presentations or special sizes that are not normally available in a particular brand.These specialities often take the form of the very finest cabinets or humidors many of which are the work of leading Cuban artists and craftsmen. Others may be made in leather or contain innovations such as humidified tubes.

Usually sold through the franchised network of [La Casa del Habano](https://www.habanos.com/donde-comprar-2/la-casa-del-habano/ "La Casa del Habano") stores, they are worth buying, if you can find them, because they are made in small quantities and will not be repeated.
