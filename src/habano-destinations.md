# Habano destinations

Now that you are nearing the end of this book, you may want some guidance on where to purchase and, just as important in these days of growing restrictions, where to light up your Habanos.

There are some places where you can do both. In others you can either buy or smoke.

When it comes to buying you want a good selection of brands and sizes in perfect condition to choose from and when it's time to smoke you want comfort and, ideally, the chance to match your cigar with a drink.

The number of Habano destinations around the world is growing. Here are some names that you might like to note.
