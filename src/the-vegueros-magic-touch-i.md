# The Vegueros' magic touch (I)

The Vegas de Primera have their own special style of cultivation, and the work that this entails is extraordinarily hard.

The Veguero – farmer – may have charge of half a million plants or more, and each must be visited more than 150 times in the course of the growing season.

#### 1 Preparing the land

June - July - August

Tobacco plants flourish in the loosest possible soil, so fields must be
ploughed very carefully in a certain pattern to a certain depth
several times before planting. Animal traction is still used, so as not
to compact the soil.

#### 2 Growing the seedling

September - October - November

Seedlings are grown in special seedbeds, with a covering of straw for
protection. Some are now grown by a new method, in floating polystyrene
seed containers sheltered inside plastic-clad 'tunnels'.

After 45 days when the seedlings reach a height of 13-15cm, they are
ready to be planted out.

#### 3 Growing full size plants

October - November - December

Some 18-20 days after planting out, the soil is banked up around the
base of the plant to promote the development of the roots, a process
called aporque.

As each plant reaches the desired height, the top bud is removed
(desbotonado) to concentrate growth on the development of larger
leaves. Removing the top bud causes an explosion of side shoots. The
farmer must make repeated visits to each plant to remove them. This is
called deshije.

#### 4 Harvesting

December - January - February

Around 40 days after planting out, the harvest can begin – a laborious
task because each leaf must be picked by hand.

Only two or three sheets can be taken at a time, and a few days should
pass between each collection. It takes about 30 days to harvest a
single plant in its entirety.

#### 5 Curing

December - January - February - March - April

The harvested leaves are taken to the farmer's barn for air curing –
just the first of many stages that the leaf has yet to pass through.

The leaves are sewn in pairs and hung astride poles which are placed on
racks in the barn.

As the leaves cure, so the pole is raised progressively higher in the
racks. Ventilation and light must be constantly adjusted to allow for
natural variations in temperature and humidity. This process lasts for
around 50 days.
