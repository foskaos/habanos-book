# Principal shapes and sizes

One of the glories of Habanos is the sheer choice – 27 brands with more than 250 different cigars between them. Here are the main shapes and sizes that it is useful to know about.

Habanos come in lengths from under 4 inches (100mm) to over 9 inches (230mm).

The industry standard measure for diameter is known as 'ring gauge' and is expressed in 64th of an inch, although some countries prefer to use millimetres. Ring gauges vary from 26 (i.e. 26⁄64 th of an inch or 10.32mm) to 57 (i.e. 57⁄64 of an inch or 22.62mm).

In Cuba, the sizes are calledvitolas. Thevitola de galerais the size name the factories use – the factory name. Thevitola de salidais the size name you find on a box – the market name.

Sometimes the market name is the same as the factory name, but not often.

The same size is often known by different market names in different brands, and different brands may sometimes use the same market name for different sizes.

On top of this, some vitolas have popular generic names like 'torpedo'.

Confused? The following examples are listed by factory name with their popular names too.

### MAREVA

Popular Name: Petit Corona
Dimensions: 5 1/8 ins x 42 ring gauge, or 129 mm x 16.67 mm diameter.

The Marevais by far the most popular of all the sizes. Its 42 ring gauge allows three filler leaves to be used to their full in the blend and it is as near as you get to a 'standard' girth for Habanos. TheMarevaorPetit Coronaoffers around 30 minutes of smoking pleasure.

### CORONA

Popular Name: Lancero

When elegance is the order of the day, the slender length of the Lancero is hard to beat. There is a shorter version too, the Coronas Especiales, which measures just 6 inches. Both originated at Havana's El Laguitofactory, the home of Cohiba, and boast the finesse of a twist of leaf on the cap. This one will take the best part of one hour to smoke.

Dimensions: 5 7/8 ins x 52 ring gauge, or 150 mm x 20.64 mm diameter.

Many consider this to be the ultímate shape and size for a Habano. Today it is acknowledged for its excellent combustion that releases the full flavourof its filler blend during the hour or so it takes to smoke. This size was chosen for the first Gran Reserva Habano.

Popular Name: Double Figurado
Dimensions: 5 3/4 ins x 46 ring gauge, or 145 mm x 18.26 mm diameter.

### How shape and size affect the taste

![Image](book_images/principal-shapes-sizes_shapes.jpg)

Each brand has its own characteristic style of flavour, but different vitolas can vary the sensation of taste.

The bigger the Habano, the richer the taste will tend to be, and the cooler the smoke.

Fat Habanos burn slowly and deliver a large volume of rounder smoke that drenches the palate with the full mixture of flavours.

Double Figuradosoffer a unique flavour at the start dominated by the wrapper and binder. The true blend is revealed when the widest part is reached.

Thinner Habanos smoke more quickly and concentrate the flavours on the tongue giving a slightly sharper taste.

The blender will to some extent compensate for these differences by, for instance, omitting the strongest flavoured ligero leaf from the blending of thinner Habano sizes.
